Yes, you can use **disk space as an extension of RAM** to handle large models that don’t fit entirely in memory. This technique is called **memory-mapped files** or **offloading**. It allows you to load only the necessary parts of the model into RAM during inference, while the rest stays on disk. Here’s how it works and how you can implement it:

---

### **1. Memory-Mapped Files (mmap)**
- **What It Does**: Maps a file on disk to a virtual memory address, allowing you to access it as if it were in RAM.
- **How It Helps**: Only the required portions of the model are loaded into RAM on demand, reducing memory usage.
- **Performance Trade-Off**: Disk access is slower than RAM, so inference speed will decrease.

#### **Implementation in C**
You can use the `mmap` system call in C to map model weights stored on disk:
```c
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    const char *filepath = "./model_weights.bin";
    int fd = open(filepath, O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    // Get file size
    size_t filesize = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);

    // Map file to memory
    void *model_weights = mmap(NULL, filesize, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
    if (model_weights == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("Error mapping file");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    // Access model weights as if they were in RAM
    float *weights = (float *)model_weights;
    printf("First weight: %f\n", weights[0]);

    // Unmap and close
    munmap(model_weights, filesize);
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Model Offloading**
- **What It Does**: Split the model into layers or chunks and load only the active parts into RAM during inference.
- **How It Helps**: Reduces peak memory usage by keeping inactive layers on disk.
- **Performance Trade-Off**: Frequent disk I/O can slow down inference.

#### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Split the Model**:
   - Save each layer’s weights to separate files (e.g., `layer1.bin`, `layer2.bin`).
2. **Load on Demand**:
   - During inference, load the weights for the current layer into RAM, compute, then unload.

Example:
```c
void load_layer(const char *filename, float *buffer, size_t layer_size) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "rb");
    fread(buffer, sizeof(float), layer_size, file);
    fclose(file);
}

void unload_layer(float *buffer) {
    // Free or reuse buffer
}

void inference(float *input, float *output, int num_layers) {
    for (int i = 0; i < num_layers; i++) {
        float layer_weights[LAYER_SIZE];
        load_layer("layer1.bin", layer_weights, LAYER_SIZE);
        // Perform computation
        unload_layer(layer_weights);
    }
}
```

### **3. Using Existing Libraries**
Several libraries support offloading and memory-mapped files for large models:

#### **A. llama.cpp**
- Supports memory-mapped files for quantized models (e.g., GGML format).
- Example:
  ```bash
  ./main -m ./models/24B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf --mmap
  ```

#### **B. Hugging Face Accelerate**
- Allows offloading parts of a model to disk or CPU.
- Example:
  ```python
  from accelerate import init_empty_weights, load_checkpoint_and_dispatch

  with init_empty_weights():
      model = MyLargeModel()

  model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(model, "model_checkpoint", device_map="auto", offload_folder="offload")
  ```

#### **C. DeepSpeed**
- Supports CPU and disk offloading for large models.
- Example:
  ```python
  ds_config = {
      "zero_optimization": {
          "stage": 3,
          "offload_param": {
              "device": "cpu",
              "pin_memory": True
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### **4. Practical Tips**
1. **Use SSDs**: Disk I/O is faster on SSDs than HDDs, reducing performance penalties.
2. **Batch Inference**: Process multiple inputs together to amortize disk access overhead.
3. **Quantization**: Combine offloading with quantization (e.g., 4-bit) to further reduce memory usage.
4. **Profile I/O**: Monitor disk usage to identify bottlenecks and optimize file access patterns.

---

### **5. Example Workflow for Your 24B Model**
1. **Quantize the Model**:
   - Use `llama.cpp` to quantize the model to 4-bit:
     ```bash
     ./quantize ./models/24B/ggml-model-f16.gguf ./models/24B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf q4_0
     ```
2. **Enable Memory Mapping**:
   - Run inference with memory-mapped files:
     ```bash
     ./main -m ./models/24B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf --mmap
     ```
3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Use tools like `htop` or `iotop` to monitor RAM and disk usage.

---

### **6. Expected Performance**
- **RAM Usage**: Significantly reduced (e.g., ~12GB for a 4-bit 24B model).
- **Inference Speed**: Slower due to disk I/O (e.g., ~0.1–0.5 tokens/second on a CPU).
- **Disk Usage**: Ensure you have enough free space (e.g., ~12GB for a 4-bit 24B model).

---

While **CPU architectures** themselves don’t directly allow "tuning" RAM and disk space dynamically, there are **software-based techniques**, **storage engines**, and **hardware configurations** that enable flexible use of RAM and disk for memory-intensive workloads like LLM inference. Below are solutions tailored to your goal of balancing RAM and disk usage for large models:

---

### **1. Virtual Memory (Swap Space)**
- **What It Is**: A built-in OS feature that uses disk space as an extension of RAM. When RAM is full, inactive memory pages are moved to a **swap file/partition** on disk.
- **How to Use It**:
  - **Linux**: Configure swap space with `swapon`/`swapoff`.
  - **Windows**: Adjust the pagefile size via System Settings.
- **Limitations**: Slow for frequent swaps (HDD/SSD latency), but useful for occasional overflows.

---

### **2. Memory-Mapped Files (mmap)**
- **What It Is**: A system call that maps disk files directly into the virtual memory address space, letting you access files as if they were in RAM.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for large models where only parts of the data are needed at a time.
- **Tools**:
  - **C/C++**: Use `mmap()`/`munmap()` (as shown earlier).
  - **Python**: `numpy.memmap` or `torch.load` with `map_location` for partial loading.

---

### **3. Database-Like Storage Engines**
These systems manage data across RAM and disk efficiently, often used in big-data applications. They can be adapted for LLM inference:

#### **A. SQLite (with mmap)**
- **Use Case**: Store model weights in a SQLite database and map parts to RAM.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  -- Enable mmap in SQLite
  PRAGMA mmap_size = 2147483648; -- 2GB of mmap
  ```
- **Limitations**: Not optimized for tensor operations, but works for simple key-value storage.

#### **B. LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database)**
- **What It Is**: A B-tree-based key-value store designed for fast memory-mapped I/O.
- **Use Case**: Store model weights in LMDB and load layers on demand.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  import lmdb
  env = lmdb.open("./model_weights", map_size=1e12)  # 1TB virtual memory
  with env.begin() as txn:
      weights = txn.get(b"layer1")  # Load from disk only when needed
  ```

#### **C. RocksDB**
- **What It Is**: A high-performance embedded database optimized for fast storage.
- **Use Case**: Cache frequently used layers in RAM (block cache) and keep others on disk.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from rocksdb import Options, DB
  opts = Options()
  opts.create_if_missing = True
  opts.max_open_files = -1  # Keep all files open
  opts.table_cache_numshardbits = 4
  db = DB('./model_weights.db', opts)
  ```

---

### **4. Hardware with Persistent Memory (Intel Optane)**
- **What It Is**: Intel Optane Persistent Memory (PMem) sits between RAM and SSD, offering large-capacity, byte-addressable storage with near-RAM speeds.
- **Use Case**: Store model weights in PMem and access them like RAM.
- **Limitations**: Requires specific hardware (Intel Xeon + Optane PMem), but provides a tunable RAM/disk-like tier.

---

### **5. Distributed Memory Systems**
- **What It Is**: Use multiple machines (or processes) to share memory across a network (e.g., Apache Arrow/Plasma, Redis).
- **Use Case**: Offload parts of the model to another machine’s RAM/disk.
- **Tools**:
  - **Redis**: Key-value store for caching model layers.
  - **Dask**: Parallel computing with spill-to-disk for large datasets.

---

### **6. Custom Memory Management for LLMs**
For LLM inference, combine quantization, memory mapping, and on-demand loading:

#### **A. llama.cpp (GGML)**
- **How It Works**: Loads model weights into memory-mapped buffers and computes in chunks.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  # Enable memory mapping for a 4-bit quantized model
  ./main -m models/24B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf --mmap
  ```

#### **B. Hugging Face Accelerate**
- **How It Works**: Offloads model layers to disk or CPU automatically.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  from accelerate import load_checkpoint_and_dispatch
  model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(
      "24B_model",
      device_map="auto",
      offload_folder="./offload",
      offload_state_dict=True
  )
  ```

---

### **7. Recommendations for Your 16GB CPU Machine**
1. **Use Quantization + mmap**:
   - Quantize the 24B model to 4-bit (~12GB) and run it with `llama.cpp --mmap`.
2. **Optimize Swap Space**:
   - Allocate a large swap file (50GB+) on an SSD to handle memory spikes.
3. **Layer Offloading**:
   - Split the model into layers and load them dynamically (e.g., with PyTorch’s `torch.load(..., map_location='cpu')`).
4. **Tiered Storage**:
   - Keep frequently used layers in RAM and others on disk (e.g., using LMDB or RocksDB).

---

### **Tools to Implement This**
- **C/C++**: `mmap`, `lmdb`, `rocksdb`.
- **Python**: `numpy.memmap`, `torch.load`, Hugging Face Accelerate.
- **LLM-Specific**: `llama.cpp`, `mlc-llm`.

---

### **Performance Expectations**
- **RAM Usage**: Reduced to ~12GB (4-bit quantized 24B model + OS overhead).
- **Inference Speed**: ~0.1–0.5 tokens/second (due to disk latency).
- **Disk Requirements**: SSD strongly recommended (HDD will be unusably slow).
