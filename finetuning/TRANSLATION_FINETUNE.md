Looking at your Odia translation task and datasets, here's my analysis and recommendations:

1. **Dataset Selection & Preparation**
- Primary Dataset: OdiEnCorp 2.0 (97K pairs) is your best starting point because:
  - It's clean and purpose-built for translation
  - Size is manageable for fine-tuning
  - Was used in WAT2020, so you have benchmark comparisons
- Validation: Use PMIndia (38K pairs) for evaluation since it's from a different domain

2. **Architecture Approach**
You have two viable options:

A. **Recommended Approach**: Fine-tune TinyLlama with instruction format
```
Instruction: Translate the following English text to Odia: "{english_text}"
Input: 
Output: {odia_text}
```

B. Alternative: Direct translation fine-tuning (not recommended since TinyLlama is instruction-tuned)

3. **Minimal Hardware Setup**
- Start with Google Colab (free tier) for prototyping
- Use QLoRA + 4-bit quantization to run on consumer GPUs
- Can run on a single RTX 3060 (12GB) or better

4. **Red Flags to Avoid**
- Don't try to use all datasets at once
- Don't attempt full model fine-tuning
- Don't skip validation splits
- Don't ignore existing benchmarks from WAT2020

Would you like me to:
1. Create a data processing script for OdiEnCorp 2.0?
2. Show you the QLoRA setup for minimal GPU usage?
3. Explain how to evaluate against WAT2020 benchmarks?
