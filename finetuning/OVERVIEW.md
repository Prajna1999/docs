I'll help you create a detailed plan for fine-tuning TinyLlama-1.1B. Given your backend development background, I'll focus on practical implementation details and infrastructure considerations.

1. **Cloud Setup**

For TinyLlama-1.1B, a single A100 (40GB) or 2-3 RTX 4090s would be sufficient. Let's focus on A100 setup as it offers the best performance/cost ratio for this size model:

Lambda Labs A100 (40GB): ~$1.10/hour
RunPod A100 (40GB): ~$0.89/hour
AWS p4d.24xlarge: ~$32.77/hour (overkill, not recommended)

Recommended: RunPod or Lambda Labs A100 with their PyTorch container.

Let's create a training environment:

```bash
# On cloud instance
git clone https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama
cd TinyLlama
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install accelerate bitsandbytes transformers
```

2. **Data Preparation**

The ideal format follows the OpenAssistant structure used in TinyLlama's original fine-tuning:



3. **Fine-tuning Method**

For TinyLlama-1.1B, I recommend starting with QLoRA since it's memory efficient and provides good results. Here are the key hyperparameters:

- Learning rate: 2e-4
- Batch size: 128 (adjust based on GPU memory)
- LoRA rank: 64
- LoRA alpha: 16
- Training epochs: 3-5
- Weight decay: 0.01
- Warmup steps: 100

4. **Training Implementation**

Let's create a training script optimized for cloud environments:

5. **Optimization Techniques**

The script above already includes key optimizations:
- 4-bit quantization via BitsAndBytes
- LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Gradient accumulation for effective batch size management
- Mixed precision training (fp16)

6. **Evaluation**

For tracking metrics during training:
- Loss curves (training and validation)
- Perplexity on validation set
- Custom metrics specific to your task

The training script uses Weights & Biases for visualization. Add custom metrics:

7. **Deployment**

After fine-tuning, convert to GGUF format for CPU inference:

```bash
# Install llama.cpp
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make

# Convert model
python convert.py path_to_your_finetuned_model --outfile model_converted.gguf

# Quantize to 4-bit for deployment
./quantize model_converted.gguf model_q4_0.gguf q4_0
```

Key Warnings/Pitfalls:
1. Always verify your cloud instance has enough storage (>100GB recommended)
2. Use gradient checkpointing if you run into OOM issues
3. Start with a small dataset subset to verify your pipeline
4. Save checkpoints frequently in case of instance termination
5. Monitor GPU utilization to optimize batch size/accumulation steps
6. Validate your model outputs regularly during training

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide additional code examples?
