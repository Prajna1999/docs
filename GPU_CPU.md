### **1. Why GPUs Are Better for Pre-Training and Inference**

GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are significantly more efficient than CPUs for training and running large language models (LLMs) like a 24B parameter model. Here’s why:

#### **A. Parallel Processing**
- **Massive Parallelism**: GPUs have thousands of cores optimized for **matrix operations** (e.g., tensor multiplications), which dominate neural network computations. CPUs, with only a few cores, struggle to parallelize these tasks efficiently.
- **SIMD Architecture**: GPUs use Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) to process large batches of data simultaneously, critical for training and inference.

#### **B. Memory Bandwidth**
- **Higher Bandwidth**: GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100: 1.5TB/s) have far greater memory bandwidth than CPUs (e.g., DDR4: ~50GB/s). This allows faster data transfer during computations, reducing bottlenecks for large models.

#### **C. Optimized Software Stack**
- **Libraries**: Frameworks like CUDA, cuBLAS, and cuDNN are optimized for GPU acceleration. Tools like PyTorch/TensorFlow automatically leverage GPUs for speed.
- **Mixed Precision**: GPUs support FP16/INT8 computations (via Tensor Cores), reducing memory usage and speeding up inference.

#### **D. Energy Efficiency**
- GPUs perform more computations per watt, making them cost-effective for large-scale workloads.

**For Your 16GB CPU Machine**:  
A 24B model in FP32 requires **~96GB of memory** (24B params × 4 bytes), which is impossible on your laptop. Even with quantization (e.g., 4-bit), you’ll face challenges with inference speed due to CPU limitations.

### **2. How to Run Large Models on Your Laptop (CPU-Only)**

To run a 24B model on a 16GB CPU machine, you need aggressive optimizations:

#### **A. Quantization**
- **4-bit or 8-bit Quantization**: Reduce model weights from 32-bit floats to lower precision.  
  - 4-bit: `24B × 0.5 bytes = 12GB` (weights only).  
  - Use libraries like **GGML** (for CPU-focused inference) or **Bitsandbytes** to quantize models.  
  - Example: **llama.cpp** (C/C++ library) supports 4-bit quantized models like LLaMA or Mistral.

#### **B. Memory-Efficient Inference**
- **Model Offloading**: Split the model into layers and load them dynamically (but this slows down inference).  
- **Flash Attention (CPU Variants)**: Optimize attention computation to reduce memory usage.  
- **Memory Mapping**: Use memory-mapped files (e.g., `mmap` in C) to avoid loading the entire model into RAM.

#### **C. Optimized CPU Code**
- **BLAS Libraries**: Use Intel MKL or OpenBLAS to accelerate matrix multiplications.  
- **Multithreading**: Split workloads across all CPU cores (e.g., with OpenMP in C).  
- **Avoid Python Overhead**: Use C/C++ for inference (e.g., llama.cpp, which is optimized for CPUs).

#### **D. Practical Steps**
1. **Quantize the Model**:
   - Convert the model to GGML format (e.g., using `llama.cpp` scripts).  
   - Example command for 4-bit quantization:  
     ```bash
     ./quantize ./models/24B/ggml-model-f16.gguf ./models/24B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf q4_0
     ```
2. **Compile llama.cpp**:
   - Clone and build [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp):  
     ```bash
     make -j4 CC=gcc CXX=g++
     ```
3. **Run Inference**:
   ```bash
   ./main -m ./models/24B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -n 128 --threads 8
   ```
   - `--threads`: Match your CPU core count.

#### **E. Performance Expectations**
- A 24B model on a CPU may generate **~0.1–0.5 tokens/second**, depending on quantization and CPU.  
- For usable speeds, consider smaller models (e.g., 7B quantized).

### **3. Tools and Libraries**
- **GGML/llama.cpp**: Best for CPU inference (C/C++).  
- **MLC-LLM**: Optimized for heterogeneous hardware.  
- **Tinygrad**: Minimalistic framework for experimental CPU/GPU code.

---

### **4. Recommendations**
- **Downgrade Model Size**: Try a 7B or 13B model with 4-bit quantization (e.g., Mistral-7B).  
- **Use Model Distillation**: Smaller models trained to mimic larger ones (e.g., DistilBERT).  
- **Upgrade Hardware**: If possible, use cloud CPUs (e.g., AWS Graviton) or rent a GPU instance.
